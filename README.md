## Web-Design-Challenge

### Introduction
The goal of this project is create a dashboard displaying the visualizations obtained in a previous project.  The weather of 500+ cities across the world with varying distances from the equator was analyzed.  Latitude was compared to maximum temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed.  The final web design will consist of seven total pages.  

### Resources
The dataset is cities.csv, created from Python API homework and subsequent plots produced.  Original dataset created with API call from OpenWeatherMap API and using citipy library. 

### Methodology
HTML and CSS were primarily used.  Bootstrap was used for webpage structuring.  Pandas library was utilized to convert csv to html.
